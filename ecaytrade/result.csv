"Plantation Village Beach Resort,Unit 26","Due to the border closure our stunning and freshly renovated condo at Plantation Village on Seven Mile Beach is available for staycations until the end of September. The condo, the largest floor plan in the development, could not be closer to the crystal clear ocean and has views to die for from its third-floor balcony. New patio furniture includes a 6-seat table and a sectional sofa with a pull-out base that converts into a day bed for those relaxing days when chilling out and absorbing the view is the #1 priority. Outdoor ceiling fans will keep you cool watching the sunset.Inside is an amazing and tastefully decorated large open plan living area with a panoramic view, widescreen HD TV with plenty of room for everyone on the large sofas. The brand-new kitchen is fully stocked with new stainless steel equipment and tableware. Even a chef would be happy here! Particular attention to detail includes a wine fridge and cocktail maker, outdoor tableware, blender, coffee maker, kettle.  The dining area seats 6 in comfort.In the Master Bedroom there is a super-comfortable king size bed, HD TV and en-suite bathroom with a walk in shower. The second bedroom features new twin beds and the third bedroom, overlooking the beach, features a queen size double bed and en-suite bathroom with a tub/shower combination. All bedrooms have brand new furniture and bedding and fitted wardrobes.Other features include a washer/dryer, a safe for valuables and brand new air-conditioning throughout. As seasoned vacation renters ourselves we know how disappointing it is to arrive and find tired accommodation with mismatched, second hand equipment. That’s why we when we renovated we decided to do a proper job, renewing virtually everything!Plantation Village boasts two large pools – one with a sea view immediately under the balcony, and an even larger pool in the middle of the complex. There is also free wifi, a tennis court and two large BBQ grill stations, one a stone’s throw from the condo, and a kids’ play area with a climbing frame and swings. Kayaks, bikes and paddle boards are available from the resort at no charge and there is a dive gear cleaning station for scuba divers. We have provided a new travel crib with sheets, high chair, beach toys, snorkel equipment, tennis racquets, toys and games.The southern end of Seven Mile Beach is variable and at the time of writing there is a small cove of beach which is big enough for kids to play and build sandcastles but not big enough for any loungers.  To get to the rest of Seven Mile Beach you have to wade for a few minutes or walk on the road but once you have done that you are minutes from the Marriott and all of its facilities.We are offering  a much reduced rate of US$250 per night, with a minimum 3-night stay, 7th night free, no hidden extras.

No expense was spared with the Wellborn custom cabinetry topped with stunning Brazilian Blue Bahia granite and double sinks made of solid white Quartz. KitchenAid appliances and small wares finish out and compliment the kitchen.  In the center of the dining room, you will find a beautiful 8 seat wooden table with a glass top, designed and built in the shape of a boat surrounded by polished metal chairs. The entertainment/living room boasts a 6 seater Italian leather sofa with a wall-mounted 86” LG 4K HDR Smart LED UHD TV w/ AI Thin Q.  Furnishings were carefully selected from Caracole, Theodore Alexander, Eames, Macy’s, Modani and Tommy Bahama, etc. to provide both comfort and style.

Features include: Tommy Bahama hand-carved king-size beds, Brazilian Typhoon granite vanity countertops, and Kohler sinks and faucets.The kitchen has an “open” concept; standing at the waterfall island you have a direct view of the Caribbean Ocean. No expense was spared with the Wellborn custom cabinetry topped with stunning Brazilian Blue Bahia granite and double sinks made of solid white Quartz. KitchenAid appliances and small wares finish out and compliment the kitchen.  In the center of the dining room, you will find a beautiful 8 seat wooden table with a glass top, designed and built in the shape of a boat surrounded by polished metal chairs. The entertainment/living room boasts a 6 seater Italian leather sofa with a wall-mounted 86” LG 4K HDR Smart LED UHD TV w/ AI Thin Q.  Furnishings were carefully selected from Caracole, Theodore Alexander, Eames, Macy’s, Modani and Tommy Bahama, etc. to provide both comfort and style.
