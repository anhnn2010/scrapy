Know when your customers have viewed your invoices and even printed them!  Slick mobile app
Cons: Pricing has gone up vis a vis other comparable competitors.  Ticketing is very basic.  One issue that could have been done better is that this is more of a quoting system and not proposal based.  So making fancier proposals you are best off using another platform. "
